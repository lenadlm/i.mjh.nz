    <title>Walk-Ins Welcome with Bridget Phetasy</title>
    <desc>Independent journalist, Leighton Woodhouse, sits down with Bridget for an in-depth conversation about the Censorship Industrial Complex, which is an effort to create new gatekeepers so that the elite can regain control of the media narrative by controlling visibility into the distribution of information and throttling the ability to see politically inconvenient information. They discuss the difference between disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation, why there's no reason to believe that these tools would not be used by the national security state since that is where they came from, why the effort to reinstill gatekeeping will probably succeed, the terrifying openness of young people to authoritarianism, our path towards a kind of Chinese-style social credit system, how humanity is not capable of controlling the pace of technology, and that the true danger of all the AI spectacles and deep fakes is not that people are gonna believe the fake stuff - it's that they won't believe the real stuff. They also cover flash trading bots, DAs who prosecute drug dealers vs the ones who don't, gifted programs, reporting about the death of civilization from the ground, and both being Gen X Californians, which makes them bitter.
