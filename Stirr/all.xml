    <title>Walk-Ins Welcome with Bridget Phetasy</title>
    <desc>Bridget sits down with Polish-born artist, Agnieszka Pilat, who is best known for her series of heroic portraits of technology and for paintings co-created with a quadruped robot, Spot. They discuss Agnieszka's experience going from Communist Poland to non-Communist Poland, the true realities of toilet paper shortages, why you would never make casual conversation in Poland, the spirit of benevolence in America, and her perception of the US vs. the reality when she came to live here. They also cover her work with robots as an artist, how it got started, why she likes working for machines, the parallels between AI and God, her desire to be Diego Rivera for machines, whether it's possible for robots to bring the soul that humans bring to art, the adaptability of humans, the agency they assign to robots, how there's no predicting what might happen in the future with these technological advancements, and why she thinks it's our responsibility to engage with technology.

    <title>Walk-Ins Welcome with Bridget Phetasy</title>
    <desc>Independent journalist, Leighton Woodhouse, sits down with Bridget for an in-depth conversation about the Censorship Industrial Complex, which is an effort to create new gatekeepers so that the elite can regain control of the media narrative by controlling visibility into the distribution of information and throttling the ability to see politically inconvenient information. They discuss the difference between disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation, why there's no reason to believe that these tools would not be used by the national security state since that is where they came from, why the effort to reinstill gatekeeping will probably succeed, the terrifying openness of young people to authoritarianism, our path towards a kind of Chinese-style social credit system, how humanity is not capable of controlling the pace of technology, and that the true danger of all the AI spectacles and deep fakes is not that people are gonna believe the fake stuff - it's that they won't believe the real stuff. They also cover flash trading bots, DAs who prosecute drug dealers vs the ones who don't, gifted programs, reporting about the death of civilization from the ground, and both being Gen X Californians, which makes them bitter.

So "Animal Rescue," a weekly series -- aimed at children and families -- that showcases spectacular rescues of animals, should be very popular. Because people don't like to see an animal's situation get so bad that it requires rescue, the program tries to avoid those situations by instructing children on the proper care of animals, as well as giving safety tips on caring for all types of creatures.</desc>

The show's reporters and producers tell stories in topics that include farm families, consumer issues, animal welfare and crop sustainability.
